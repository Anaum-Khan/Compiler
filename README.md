# Compiler
Objective - To design and implement a complete compiler for a subset of the Swift programming language. This  compiler performs lexical analysis, syntax analysis, semantic analysis, and code generation. It translates  Swift-like source code into executable C code, generating three-address intermediate code in the process.
